### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: Jan 1, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Created a new Elixir repo, start thinking about which front-end framework to go with

**Thoughts**: I really want to use Vue for the mobile App I'll be building but Weex (the equivalent of ReactNative for VueJS) isn't ready yet. It is being converted to fully using Vue 2.0 but that may take a while before it's ready to be used. So I'm looking at using ReactNative.
