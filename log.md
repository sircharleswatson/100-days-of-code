# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: Jan 1, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Created a new Elixir repo, start thinking about which front-end framework to go with

**Thoughts**: I really want to use Vue for the mobile App I'll be building but Weex (the equivalent of ReactNative for VueJS) isn't ready yet. It is being converted to fully using Vue 2.0 but that may take a while before it's ready to be used. So I'm looking at using ReactNative.

### Day 2: Jan 2, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Initialized my first real ReactNative App.

**Thoughts**: Had to download Xcode and all that, which always takes forever.

### Day 3: Jan 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started the ReactNative tutorial in the RN docs

**Thoughts**: I decided that I need to include tutorials in my challenge because I've got a lot of other things I need to work on as well, so as long as it's a direct means to an end for the project, it's ok

### Day 4: Jan 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Tried and failed to get the Weex HackerNews iOS app running

**Thoughts**: I checked out the source and it looks super great. Building native mobile apps with Vue will be awesome but I ran into some errors that I couldn't solve that prevented the app from running.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A
