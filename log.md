### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: Jan 1, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Created a new Elixir repo, start thinking about which front-end framework to go with

**Thoughts**: I really want to use Vue for the mobile App I'll be building but Weex (the equivalent of ReactNative for VueJS) isn't ready yet. It is being converted to fully using Vue 2.0 but that may take a while before it's ready to be used. So I'm looking at using ReactNative.

### Day 2: Jan 2, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Initialized my first real ReactNative App.

**Thoughts**: Had to download Xcode and all that, which always takes forever.

### Day 3: Jan 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started the ReactNative tutorial in the RN docs

**Thoughts**: I decided that I need to include tutorials in my challenge because I've got a lot of other things I need to work on as well, so as long as it's a direct means to an end for the project, it's ok

### Day 4: Jan 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Tried and failed to get the Weex HackerNews iOS app running

**Thoughts**: I checked out the source and it looks super great. Building native mobile apps with Vue will be awesome but I ran into some errors that I couldn't solve that prevented the app from running.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 5: Jan 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on non-code aspects of my BB app

**Thoughts**: I didn't really have anything planne dout yet so I need to do that. This challenge is all about building a project, so I'm giving myself some leeway to do non-code stuff, as long as it's still towards the project. 

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 6: Jan 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: More RN tutorial

**Thoughts**: Sort of kinda worked on the RN tutorial. My keyboard was broken when I sat down to work on it so I was freaking out since my computer is brand spankin new. Got it fixed though and spend a few minutes advancing on the tutorial. Will do more tomorrow.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 7: Jan 7, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: More RN tutorial

**Thoughts**: Finished the official RN tutorial. Wasn't very helpful to be honest. Gunna be starting another one tomorrow that should give me a better idea of the whole development process. Hopefully it's better.

### Day 11: Jan 11, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Added a progress HUD to show something while the saveToCameraRoll function is working
